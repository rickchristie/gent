        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

        Call tools using YAML format:

    <thinking>
    The customer, John Smith (email: john.smith@email.com), wants to reschedule their booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-25) to a later flight on the same day, preferably evening.

    To proceed with rescheduling per guidelines:
    1. Verify customer identity and booking: Use get_customer_info with email to retrieve customer details, which may include associated bookings or customer ID.
    2. Confirm original flight details: Use get_flight_info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later alternatives.
    3. Check change policy: Use search_airline_policy with keyword 'change' to inform about fees/rules.
    4. Find alternatives: Use search_flight_schedule for JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25 to identify later flights.

    Perform these in parallel as first actions. No booking ID yet, so cannot get booking details or reschedule immediately. After tools, I can proceed step-by-step.

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.
        </task>

        <thinking>
        The customer, John Smith (email: john.smith@email.com), wants to reschedule their booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-25) to a later flight on the same day, preferably evening.

        To proceed with rescheduling per guidelines:
        1. Verify customer identity and booking: Use get_customer_info with email to retrieve customer details, which may include associated bookings or customer ID.
        2. Confirm original flight details: Use get_flight_info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later alternatives.
        3. Check change policy: Use search_airline_policy with keyword 'change' to inform about fees/rules.
        4. Find alternatives: Use search_flight_schedule for JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25 to identify later flights.

        Perform these in parallel as first actions. No booking ID yet, so cannot get booking details or reschedule immediately. After tools, I can proceed step-by-step.

    Customer ID: C001 (John Smith, Gold tier). Bookings: BK001, BK002. Original flight AA100 departs 2026-01-25T08:00Z (tomorrow morning). Alternatives on same day: AA101 (14:00Z, afternoon), AA102 (20:00Z, evening - matches preference).

    Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Change >24 hours before departure: $50 economy fee normally, but free for Gold. No fare difference issue as AA102 economy is cheaper ($279 vs $299).

    Today 2026-01-24, departure 08:00Z tomorrow: >24 hours, qualifies for free change.

    Next: Retrieve details for both bookings to identify which is for AA100 (JFK-LAX 2026-01-25). Check seat availability on preferred AA102 (evening flight). Assume economy unless specified in booking.

    Parallel calls: get_booking_info for BK001 and BK002; get_flight_seats_info for AA102 (economy, available only).

        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

        <available_tools>
        Call tools using YAML format:
        tool: tool_name
        args:
          param: value

        For multiple parallel calls, use a list:
        - tool: tool1
          args:
            param: value
        - tool: tool2
          args:

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.
        </task>

        <thinking>
        The customer, John Smith (email: john.smith@email.com), wants to reschedule their booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-25) to a later flight on the same day, preferably evening.

        To proceed with rescheduling per guidelines:
        1. Verify customer identity and booking: Use get_customer_info with email to retrieve customer details, which may include associated bookings or customer ID.
        2. Confirm original flight details: Use get_flight_info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later alternatives.
        3. Check change policy: Use search_airline_policy with keyword 'change' to inform about fees/rules.
        4. Find alternatives: Use search_flight_schedule for JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25 to identify later flights.

        Perform these in parallel as first actions. No booking ID yet, so cannot get booking details or reschedule immediately. After tools, I can proceed step-by-step.

    Customer's relevant booking is BK001: AA100 economy seat 12A, confirmed, $299. Customer is Gold tier, eligible for 1 free change per booking. Change is >24 hours before departure (today 2026-01-24, dep 2026-01-25T08:00Z), so free (no $50 fee). AA102 evening flight (20:00Z) cheaper at $279 economy, so $20 travel credit per policy.

    Alternatives: AA101 (14:00Z, $329 economy - more expensive, fare diff applies), AA102 preferred.

    get_flight_seats_info failed for AA102 (no data), but search_flight_schedule shows 67 available seats, so feasible.

    All verification done. Now inform customer of policy, no fees, options (prefer AA102), any fare diff/credit, and confirm before rescheduling. Since ReAct cycle, provide polite professional response in <answer> with details from tools only. Ask for confirmation on flight (e.g., AA102) and if specific seat desired (none available from tool). No hallucination: no specific new seat, prices/dates/times from tools.

    No further tools needed yet; wait for customer confirmation in next interaction, but since task is to help reschedule, present and prepare.
