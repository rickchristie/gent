    <thinking>
    The customer is John Smith with email john.smith@email.com, wanting to reschedule flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-25) to a later flight, preferably evening.

    Steps required:
    1. Verify customer identity and find booking details using email.
    2. Confirm current flight details (AA100).
    3. Check change policy.
    4. Search for alternative later flights on 2026-01-25 from JFK to LAX.

    I can call multiple tools in parallel:
    - get_customer_info to verify customer and get ID/bookings.
    - get_flight_info for AA100 to know its schedule.
    - search_airline_policy for 'change' keyword.
    - search_flight_schedule for JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25 to find later options.

    Once I have booking ID from customer info, I can proceed to check seats and reschedule if appropriate.

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.

        The customer is John Smith with email john.smith@email.com, wanting to reschedule flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-25) to a later flight, preferably evening.

        Steps required:
        1. Verify customer identity and find booking details using email.
        2. Confirm current flight details (AA100).
        3. Check change policy.
        4. Search for alternative later flights on 2026-01-25 from JFK to LAX.

        I can call multiple tools in parallel:
        - get_customer_info to verify customer and get ID/bookings.
        - get_flight_info for AA100 to know its schedule.
        - search_airline_policy for 'change' keyword.
        - search_flight_schedule for JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25 to find later options.

        Once I have booking ID from customer info, I can proceed to check seats and reschedule if appropriate.

    Customer C001 has bookings BK001 and BK002. Need to identify which one is for AA100 on 2026-01-25.

    AA100 departs 2026-01-25T08:00Z (early morning). Alternatives: AA101 (14:00 afternoon), AA102 (20:00 evening, preferred, cheaper at $279 economy vs $299).

    Policy: Gold tier (customer is gold) gets 1 free change per booking. Since >24 hours before departure, free change applies. If new flight cheaper, travel credit.

    Next actions:
    - Get booking info for both BK001 and BK002 to confirm which is the AA100 booking.
    - Check seat availability on AA102 (evening flight, preferred).

    Once confirmed, inform customer of options, fees (free), and proceed to reschedule if they confirm, but since this is chat, propose and wait? No, as agent, guide through.

    In ReAct, gather info then answer.

        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
