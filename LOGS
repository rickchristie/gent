        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.

  Content:
    <thinking>
    The customer is John Smith with email john.smith@email.com. They have a booking on flight AA100 from JFK to LAX tomorrow, and want to reschedule to a later flight on the same day, preferably evening.

    Today is {{.Time.Today}}, so tomorrow is the next day. I need the exact date for searching flights, but first priority is to verify identity and booking.

    Steps for rescheduling:
    1. Verify customer and get booking details (need booking ID).
    2. Check change policy.
    3. Get details of current flight AA100.
    4. Search for alternative later flights from JFK to LAX on tomorrow's date.

    Since date is templated, assume tools can handle or infer from context. But search_flight_schedule requires YYYY-MM-DD. I may need booking info first to confirm date.

    Parallel actions:
    - Get customer info by email to verify identity, get customer ID, and likely associated bookings/booking ID.
    - Get flight info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later flights.
    - Search airline policy for 'change' to check fees/policy.

    Once I have booking ID and tomorrow's date confirmed, search for alternative flights.
    No final answer yet; need tool results.

      Content:
        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.
  [2] Role: ai

        The customer is John Smith with email john.smith@email.com. They have a booking on flight AA100 from JFK to LAX tomorrow, and want to reschedule to a later flight on the same day, preferably evening.

        Today is {{.Time.Today}}, so tomorrow is the next day. I need the exact date for searching flights, but first priority is to verify identity and booking.

        Steps for rescheduling:
        1. Verify customer and get booking details (need booking ID).
        2. Check change policy.
        3. Get details of current flight AA100.
        4. Search for alternative later flights from JFK to LAX on tomorrow's date.

        Since date is templated, assume tools can handle or infer from context. But search_flight_schedule requires YYYY-MM-DD. I may need booking info first to confirm date.

        Parallel actions:
        - Get customer info by email to verify identity, get customer ID, and likely associated bookings/booking ID.
        - Get flight info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later flights.
        - Search airline policy for 'change' to check fees/policy.

        Once I have booking ID and tomorrow's date confirmed, search for alternative flights.
        No final answer yet; need tool results.

    Customer verified: C001, John Smith, gold tier (1 free change per booking).

    Flight AA100: Departs 2026-01-21T08:00:00Z (early morning) from JFK to LAX. So tomorrow is 2026-01-21.

    Customer has two bookings: BK001, BK002. Need to identify which one is for AA100 on 2026-01-21.

    Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Since >24 hours before departure (assuming call is today), free change + any fare difference.

    Next steps:
    - Get booking info for BK001 and BK002 to confirm which is the relevant booking (likely one matches AA100).
    - Search for alternative flights: JFK to LAX on 2026-01-21, later than 08:00Z, preferably evening (e.g., after 17:00 local? But times in Z).
    - Once identified, inform of free change (gold benefit), propose options.

    Call tools in parallel.

        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.


        ## Task Description

        You are a helpful airline customer service agent for SkyWings Airlines.
        Your role is to assist customers with their flight bookings, including checking flight information,
        rescheduling flights, and answering policy questions.

        Today is {{.Time.Today}} ({{.Time.Weekday}}).

        Always be polite and professional. When rescheduling, make sure to:
        1. Verify the customer's identity and booking
        2. Check the airline's change policy
        3. Search for available alternative flights
        4. Inform the customer of any fees before making changes
        5. Confirm the change and provide updated booking details

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.

        The customer is John Smith with email john.smith@email.com. They have a booking on flight AA100 from JFK to LAX tomorrow, and want to reschedule to a later flight on the same day, preferably evening.

        Today is {{.Time.Today}}, so tomorrow is the next day. I need the exact date for searching flights, but first priority is to verify identity and booking.

        Steps for rescheduling:
        1. Verify customer and get booking details (need booking ID).
        2. Check change policy.
        3. Get details of current flight AA100.
        4. Search for alternative later flights from JFK to LAX on tomorrow's date.

        Since date is templated, assume tools can handle or infer from context. But search_flight_schedule requires YYYY-MM-DD. I may need booking info first to confirm date.

        Parallel actions:
        - Get customer info by email to verify identity, get customer ID, and likely associated bookings/booking ID.
        - Get flight info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later flights.
        - Search airline policy for 'change' to check fees/policy.

        Once I have booking ID and tomorrow's date confirmed, search for alternative flights.
        No final answer yet; need tool results.

        Flight AA100: Departs 2026-01-21T08:00:00Z (early morning) from JFK to LAX. So tomorrow is 2026-01-21.

        Customer has two bookings: BK001, BK002. Need to identify which one is for AA100 on 2026-01-21.

        Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Since >24 hours before departure (assuming call is today), free change + any fare difference.

        Next steps:
        - Get booking info for BK001 and BK002 to confirm which is the relevant booking (likely one matches AA100).
        - Search for alternative flights: JFK to LAX on 2026-01-21, later than 08:00Z, preferably evening (e.g., after 17:00 local? But times in Z).

    Booking confirmed: BK001 for AA100, economy 12A, $299. Customer gold tier: 1 free change.

    Alternatives on 2026-01-21 JFK-LAX:
    - AA101: 14:00Z, economy $329 (+$30 fare diff)
    - AA102: 20:00Z evening, economy $279 (-$20 credit)

    Free change for gold tier. No fee, just fare diff/credit.

    Enough info to respond: Verify, inform policy/fees, propose options (prefer evening AA102), ask confirmation for reschedule.

    If they confirm later, can act. For now, final polite response with details.
