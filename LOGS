    Customer C001 has bookings BK001 and BK002. Need to identify which one is for AA100 on 2026-01-21 JFK-LAX.

    AA100 departs 08:00 UTC on 2026-01-21 (early morning). Alternatives: AA101 (14:00), AA102 (20:00 evening) - matches preference.

    Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Since >24 hours before departure, free anyway.

    Next actions:
    - Get booking info for BK001 and BK002 to confirm the relevant booking.
    - Get flight seats info for AA102 (evening flight, assume economy unless specified).
    - Possibly for AA101 if needed.

    Once confirmed, propose reschedule to AA102, inform of free change, and proceed if ok. But since this is agent, gather then respond or act.

        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.

    Confirmed: Booking BK001 for customer C001 (John Smith) is AA100 economy seat 12A on 2026-01-21, departing 08:00 UTC JFK-LAX.

    BK002 is unrelated.

    Gold tier: Free change.

    Alternatives: AA101 (14:00), AA102 (20:00 evening, preferred, cheaper at $279 economy vs original $299, so travel credit of $20).

    Seats info failed for AA102 economy, but schedule shows 67 available seats total, so assume available.

    Enough info. Now respond politely:
    - Verify identity/booking.
    - State policy: Free change as gold member.
    - Propose AA102 evening flight.
    - Inform no fee, possible credit.
    - Ask confirmation to proceed with reschedule.
    - If yes, then in next turn use reschedule tool.

    Since ReAct, and task is to assist, provide answer now without further tools.
