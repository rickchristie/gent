        2. Check the airline's change policy

        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

        <available_tools>
        Call tools using YAML format:
        tool: tool_name

          args:
            param: value
        - tool: tool2
          args:
            param: value

        For strings with special characters (colons, quotes) or multiple lines, use double quotes:
        - tool: send_email
          args:
            subject: "Unsubscribe Confirmation: Newsletter"

    <thinking>
    Customer is John Smith, email john.smith@email.com, wants to reschedule booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-27) to a later flight same day, preferably evening.

    To proceed with rescheduling per guidelines:
    1. Verify identity and booking: Use get_customer_info with email to retrieve customer details (likely including customer ID and bookings).
    2. Confirm current flight details: Use get_flight_info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later alternatives.
    3. Check change policy: Use search_airline_policy with keyword "change" to inform about fees/rules.

    No booking ID provided yet, so customer info should provide it. Date for alternatives is 2026-01-27. Will search flights after getting current flight time.

    Parallel tool calls for efficiency.

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.
        </task>

        <thinking>
        Customer is John Smith, email john.smith@email.com, wants to reschedule booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-27) to a later flight same day, preferably evening.

        To proceed with rescheduling per guidelines:
        1. Verify identity and booking: Use get_customer_info with email to retrieve customer details (likely including customer ID and bookings).
        2. Confirm current flight details: Use get_flight_info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later alternatives.
        3. Check change policy: Use search_airline_policy with keyword "change" to inform about fees/rules.

        No booking ID provided yet, so customer info should provide it. Date for alternatives is 2026-01-27. Will search flights after getting current flight time.

        Parallel tool calls for efficiency.

    Customer C001 (John Smith, gold frequent flyer) has bookings BK001 and BK002. Need to identify which one is for AA100 on 2026-01-27 to verify and reschedule.

    Flight AA100 departs 2026-01-27T08:00:00Z (early morning). Today is 2026-01-26, so change is more than 24 hours before departure. As gold member, entitled to 1 free change per booking (no fee, but fare difference may apply).

    Search for later flights JFK to LAX on 2026-01-27, preferably evening (after ~18:00 local, but use UTC for now).

    Parallel calls: get_booking_info for both bookings to confirm which matches AA100/JFK-LAX/2026-01-27. search_flight_schedule for alternatives on 2026-01-27.

        ## Task Description

        You are a helpful airline customer service agent for SkyWings Airlines.
        Your role is to assist customers with their flight bookings, including checking flight information,
        rescheduling flights, and answering policy questions.

        Today is 2026-01-26 (Monday).

        Always be polite and professional. When rescheduling, make sure to:
        1. Verify the customer's identity and booking
        2. Check the airline's change policy
        3. Search for available alternative flights
        4. Inform the customer of any fees before making changes
        5. Confirm the change and provide updated booking details


        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

        <available_tools>
        Call tools using YAML format:
        tool: tool_name
        args:
          param: value

        For multiple parallel calls, use a list:
        - tool: tool1
          args:
            param: value
        - tool: tool2
          args:
            param: value

        For strings with special characters (colons, quotes) or multiple lines, use double quotes:
        - tool: send_email
          args:
            subject: "Unsubscribe Confirmation: Newsletter"
            body: "You have been unsubscribed.\n\nYou will no longer receive emails from us."

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.
        </task>

        <thinking>
        Customer is John Smith, email john.smith@email.com, wants to reschedule booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-27) to a later flight same day, preferably evening.

        To proceed with rescheduling per guidelines:
        1. Verify identity and booking: Use get_customer_info with email to retrieve customer details (likely including customer ID and bookings).
        2. Confirm current flight details: Use get_flight_info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later alternatives.
        3. Check change policy: Use search_airline_policy with keyword "change" to inform about fees/rules.

        No booking ID provided yet, so customer info should provide it. Date for alternatives is 2026-01-27. Will search flights after getting current flight time.

        Parallel tool calls for efficiency.

    Booking confirmed: BK001 for AA100 on 2026-01-27T08:00Z, economy seat 12A, price $299. Customer is gold frequent flyer: entitled to 1 free change per booking (no fee). Change >24h before departure.

    Alternatives on 2026-01-27 JFK-LAX:
    - AA101: 14:00Z ($329 economy, +$30 fare difference)
    - AA102: 20:00Z evening ($279 economy, -$20 as travel credit)

    Plenty seats available (23/67). No need for seat-specific check yet.

    Enough info: Inform customer of policy (free change for gold, fare diff), present options (prefer evening so highlight AA102), ask for preferred flight and seat preference if any, then can reschedule in next interaction. Do not reschedule without confirmation.

    No more tools needed. Provide polite professional response with details.

Booking confirmed: BK001 for AA100 on 2026-01-27T08:00Z, economy seat 12A, price $299. Customer is gold frequent flyer: entitled to 1 free change per booking (no fee). Change >24h before departure.

Alternatives on 2026-01-27 JFK-LAX:
- AA101: 14:00Z ($329 economy, +$30 fare difference)
- AA102: 20:00Z evening ($279 economy, -$20 as travel credit)

Plenty seats available (23/67). No need for seat-specific check yet.

Enough info: Inform customer of policy (free change for gold, fare diff), present options (prefer evening so highlight AA102), ask for preferred flight and seat preference if any, then can reschedule in next interaction. Do not reschedule without confirmation.

No more tools needed. Provide polite professional response with details.

Hello John Smith,

Thank you for contacting SkyWings Airlines customer service. I have verified your identity and details associated with john.smith@email.com (Customer ID: C001). You have a confirmed booking BK001 for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX departing tomorrow, January 27, 2026, at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total price $299).

As a Gold frequent flyer member, you are eligible for one free change per booking with no change fee. Any fare difference will apply: if the new flight is more expensive, you'll pay the difference; if cheaper, you'll receive the difference as travel credit. Since your request is more than 24 hours before departure, this qualifies under our standard policy.

I searched for later flights on the same route and date (2026-01-27). Here are available options after your current departure time:

- **Flight AA101**: Departs JFK at 14:00 UTC, arrives LAX 17:30 UTC. Economy price: $329 (fare difference: +$30 to pay). 23 economy seats available.
- **Flight AA102** (evening option): Departs JFK at 20:00 UTC, arrives LAX 23:30 UTC. Economy price: $279 (fare difference: -$20 travel credit). 67 economy seats available.

Which flight would you like to reschedule to? Do you have a preferred seat (e.g., aisle/window) on the new flight? Please reply with your choice (e.g., "AA102"), and I'll process the change immediately, confirm the updated details, and send a notification to your email.

We're here to help—safe travels!

Best regards,
SkyWings Airlines Customer Service
