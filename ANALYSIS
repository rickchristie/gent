Analysis                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                 
  The separation is fundamentally sound. You have a clear distinction between:                                                                   
  - LoopData = Active state for execution (mutable, drives the loop)                                                                             
  - ExecutionTrace/IterationTrace = Observability data (collected after the fact)                                                                
                                                                                                                                                 
  Recommendations                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                 
  1. Naming: IterationInfo vs IterationTrace is confusing                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                 
  Both describe "something about an iteration" but serve different purposes. Consider renaming IterationInfo to something like IterationContext  
  or IterationMessages to make it clearer that it holds the message content for prompt construction, not trace/metrics data.                     
                                                                                                                                                 
  2. Minor data duplication in IterationTrace.Result                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                 
  IterationTrace.Result stores the full *AgentLoopResult, which includes NextPrompt. But that prompt content will also flow into                 
  IterationInfo.Messages for the next iteration. This means the same data exists in two places:                                                  
  - Once in trace (for observability)                                                                                                            
  - Once in LoopData (for execution)                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                 
  This is probably fine since the purposes are different, but worth being aware of.                                                              
                                                                                                                                                 
  3. Consider whether TraceCollector should be integrated with LoopData                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                 
  Currently TraceCollector is standalone. If tracing is common, you might add an optional GetTraceCollector() method to LoopData so hooks and the
   executor can automatically capture trace data without the AgentLoop implementation manually managing it.                                      
                                                                                                                                                 
  4. The [][]*IterationInfo type is hard to read                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                 
  The double slice [][]*IterationInfo suggests grouping iterations, but the purpose isn't immediately clear from the type. A named type like type
   IterationGroup []*IterationInfo might help readability.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                 
  Summary                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                 
  No major overlap or redundancy - the design makes sense. The main improvement opportunity is naming clarity between IterationInfo (content for 
  prompts) and IterationTrace (metrics/observability).
