        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>
        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

    The customer is John Smith, email john.smith@email.com, wants to reschedule booking for flight AA100 JFK-LAX on 2026-01-29 (tomorrow) to a later flight same day, preferably evening.

    Steps per policy:
    1. Verify identity and booking: Use get_customer_info with email to get customer details and likely booking ID(s).
    2. Check change policy: Use search_airline_policy with keyword "change".
    3. Get original flight details: Use get_flight_info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later flights.
    4. Search alternatives: Use search_flight_schedule JFK to LAX on 2026-01-29 for later flights.

    Call these in parallel to gather info efficiently. No booking ID yet, so can't get_booking_info. After this, propose options, inform fees, confirm.

        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.

        The customer is John Smith, email john.smith@email.com, wants to reschedule booking for flight AA100 JFK-LAX on 2026-01-29 (tomorrow) to a later flight same day, preferably evening.

        Steps per policy:
        1. Verify identity and booking: Use get_customer_info with email to get customer details and likely booking ID(s).
        2. Check change policy: Use search_airline_policy with keyword "change".
        3. Get original flight details: Use get_flight_info for AA100 to know departure time, so I can find later flights.
        4. Search alternatives: Use search_flight_schedule JFK to LAX on 2026-01-29 for later flights.

        Call these in parallel to gather info efficiently. No booking ID yet, so can't get_booking_info. After this, propose options, inform fees, confirm.

    Gold tier: 1 free change per booking.

    Original AA100: 08:00Z departure.

    Alternatives same day later: AA101 14:00Z (afternoon), AA102 20:00Z (evening, preferred).

    Change >24h before, free for Gold.

    Next: Get booking details for BK001 and BK002 to confirm which one, verify it's changeable, class, etc.

    Then, can propose options, check seats if needed, inform fees (likely $0), get confirmation before reschedule.

        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.

        Customer C001 (Gold tier), has bookings BK001 and BK002. Need to identify which is for AA100 on 2026-01-29.

        Gold tier: 1 free change per booking.

        Original AA100: 08:00Z departure.

        Alternatives same day later: AA101 14:00Z (afternoon), AA102 20:00Z (evening, preferred).

        Change >24h before, free for Gold.

        Next: Get booking details for BK001 and BK002 to confirm which one, verify it's changeable, class, etc.

        Then, can propose options, check seats if needed, inform fees (likely $0), get confirmation before reschedule.

    Identified correct booking: BK001 for AA100 economy seat 12A, confirmed, $299.

    Customer Gold tier: 1 free change per booking.

    Change >24 hours before departure: free (no fee).

    Alternatives on 2026-01-29 JFK-LAX later than 08:00Z:
    - AA101: 14:00Z, economy $329 (+$30 fare difference)
    - AA102: 20:00Z evening, economy $279 (-$20 as travel credit)

    Plenty seats available.

    Enough info: Propose evening AA102 as preferred, inform free change, fare credit, ask confirmation to proceed with reschedule. If yes, then use reschedule_booking tool next, but since this is response, provide polite agent reply with details.

    No more tools needed now.

    Your current booking BK001 is for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on 2026-01-29, departing at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total $299).

    Since you are a Gold frequent flyer, you qualify for one free change per booking. As this request is more than 24 hours before departure, there is no change fee. Any fare difference will apply: credit if cheaper, payment if more expensive.

<thinking>
Customer C001 (Gold tier), has bookings BK001 and BK002. Need to identify which is for AA100 on 2026-01-29.

Gold tier: 1 free change per booking.

Original AA100: 08:00Z departure.

Alternatives same day later: AA101 14:00Z (afternoon), AA102 20:00Z (evening, preferred).

Change >24h before, free for Gold.

Next: Get booking details for BK001 and BK002 to confirm which one, verify it's changeable, class, etc.

Then, can propose options, check seats if needed, inform fees (likely $0), get confirmation before reschedule.

--- Iteration 3 ---

<thinking>
Identified correct booking: BK001 for AA100 economy seat 12A, confirmed, $299.

Customer Gold tier: 1 free change per booking.

Change >24 hours before departure: free (no fee).

Alternatives on 2026-01-29 JFK-LAX later than 08:00Z:
- AA101: 14:00Z, economy $329 (+$30 fare difference)
- AA102: 20:00Z evening, economy $279 (-$20 as travel credit)

Plenty seats available.

Enough info: Propose evening AA102 as preferred, inform free change, fare credit, ask confirmation to proceed with reschedule. If yes, then use reschedule_booking tool next, but since this is response, provide polite agent reply with details.

No more tools needed now.

Hello John Smith, thank you for contacting SkyWings Airlines customer service. I have verified your identity and booking details using your email (john.smith@email.com).

Your current booking BK001 is for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on 2026-01-29, departing at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total $299).

Since you are a Gold frequent flyer, you qualify for one free change per booking. As this request is more than 24 hours before departure, there is no change fee. Any fare difference will apply: credit if cheaper, payment if more expensive.

Available later flights on the same day (2026-01-29):
- AA101 departing 14:00 UTC, arriving 17:30 UTC, economy price $329 (fare difference +$30 USD)
- AA102 departing 20:00 UTC (evening), arriving 23:30 UTC, economy price $279 (fare credit $20 USD) - 67 seats available.

I recommend AA102 as your preferred evening option. Both have available economy seats.

Would you like to reschedule to AA102 (or another option)? Please confirm, and specify any seat preference if desired. Once confirmed, I will process the change and send you updated details.

Looking forward to your reply!
