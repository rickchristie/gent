        ## Task Description

        You are a helpful airline customer service agent for SkyWings Airlines.

        Today is 2026-01-26 (Monday).

        Always be polite and professional. When rescheduling, make sure to:
        1. Verify the customer's identity and booking
        2. Check the airline's change policy
        3. Search for available alternative flights
        4. Inform the customer of any fees before making changes
        5. Confirm the change and provide updated booking details


        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

    The customer is John Smith with email john.smith@email.com. He wants to reschedule a booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-27). No booking ID provided, so first verify customer identity and retrieve booking details using get_customer_info with email. Also, get details on original flight AA100 using get_flight_info to know departure time for finding later alternatives. Check change policy using search_airline_policy. Search for alternative flights on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX using search_flight_schedule to find later options, preferably evening.
    Parallel tool calls: get_customer_info, get_flight_info for AA100, search_airline_policy for 'change', search_flight_schedule for JFK-LAX on 2026-01-27.

        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.

        The customer is John Smith with email john.smith@email.com. He wants to reschedule a booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-27). No booking ID provided, so first verify customer identity and retrieve booking details using get_customer_info with email. Also, get details on original flight AA100 using get_flight_info to know departure time for finding later alternatives. Check change policy using search_airline_policy. Search for alternative flights on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX using search_flight_schedule to find later options, preferably evening.
        Parallel tool calls: get_customer_info, get_flight_info for AA100, search_airline_policy for 'change', search_flight_schedule for JFK-LAX on 2026-01-27.

    Customer has two bookings: BK001 and BK002. Need to retrieve details for both to identify which one is for AA100 on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX. Original flight AA100 departs at 08:00Z (early morning). Alternatives: AA101 at 14:00Z (afternoon), AA102 at 20:00Z (evening, preferred). Customer is Gold tier, so entitled to 1 free change per booking per policy. Change is more than 24 hours before departure (today 2026-01-26, flight 2026-01-27 08:00Z), so free anyway for Gold. New flights: AA102 cheaper economy (279 vs 299), so no fare difference charge, possible credit. Next: Get booking details for BK001/BK002, check seat availability on AA102 (evening preferred, economy assumed unless specified).
    Parallel calls: get_booking_info for both, get_flight_seats_info for AA102 (available_only true, assume economy).

        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly

        Customer has two bookings: BK001 and BK002. Need to retrieve details for both to identify which one is for AA100 on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX. Original flight AA100 departs at 08:00Z (early morning). Alternatives: AA101 at 14:00Z (afternoon), AA102 at 20:00Z (evening, preferred). Customer is Gold tier, so entitled to 1 free change per booking per policy. Change is more than 24 hours before departure (today 2026-01-26, flight 2026-01-27 08:00Z), so free anyway for Gold. New flights: AA102 cheaper economy (279 vs 299), so no fare difference charge, possible credit. Next: Get booking details for BK001/BK002, check seat availability on AA102 (evening preferred, economy assumed unless specified).
        Parallel calls: get_booking_info for both, get_flight_seats_info for AA102 (available_only true, assume economy).

    Customer identity verified: C001, John Smith. Relevant booking is BK001 for AA100 on 2026-01-27T08:00:00Z, economy class, seat 12A, price 299. BK002 is unrelated (AA200 business). Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking; change >24h before departure, so no fee. Alternatives found: AA101 (14:00Z departure), AA102 (20:00Z evening, preferred, cheaper at 279 economy, 67 seats available). Seat info unavailable for AA102, but general availability confirmed. Fare difference: credit of $20 possible for AA102. Sufficient info to inform customer of options, policy, no fees, and offer to proceed with reschedule to AA102 (or AA101). No need for more tools; respond politely, confirm details, propose change, await confirmation before calling reschedule_booking tool in future interaction. Be professional.

    Hello Mr. John Smith (Customer ID: C001),

    Thank you for contacting SkyWings Airlines customer service. I've verified your details using your email (john.smith@email.com) and confirmed your booking BK001 for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on 2026-01-27 at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total price: $299).

    I understand your meeting is running late, and you'd like to reschedule to a later flight on the same day, preferably evening. Our records show you're a Gold frequent flyer member, which entitles you to one free change per booking. Additionally, since this request is more than 24 hours before departure, there is no change fee applicable.

    Available alternative flights on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX (all scheduled with availability):
    - AA101: Departs 14:00 UTC, arrives 17:30 UTC (economy price: $329, 23 seats available)
    - AA102: Departs 20:00 UTC (evening), arrives 23:30 UTC (economy price: $279, 67 seats available) – this matches your preference and is cheaper than your original ($20 difference as travel credit).

    No fare difference charge applies if selecting AA102 (credit issued); AA101 would incur a $30 upcharge.

    Would you like me to reschedule BK001 to AA102 (or AA101)? Please confirm the flight number, and let me know if you have a seat preference (economy class assumed; specific seat availability details are currently unavailable, but general seats are open). Once confirmed, I'll process the change immediately and send you updated details.

    Looking forward to your confirmation!

    Best regards,
    SkyWings Airlines Customer Service

Customer has two bookings: BK001 and BK002. Need to retrieve details for both to identify which one is for AA100 on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX. Original flight AA100 departs at 08:00Z (early morning). Alternatives: AA101 at 14:00Z (afternoon), AA102 at 20:00Z (evening, preferred). Customer is Gold tier, so entitled to 1 free change per booking per policy. Change is more than 24 hours before departure (today 2026-01-26, flight 2026-01-27 08:00Z), so free anyway for Gold. New flights: AA102 cheaper economy (279 vs 299), so no fare difference charge, possible credit. Next: Get booking details for BK001/BK002, check seat availability on AA102 (evening preferred, economy assumed unless specified).
Parallel calls: get_booking_info for both, get_flight_seats_info for AA102 (available_only true, assume economy).

Customer identity verified: C001, John Smith. Relevant booking is BK001 for AA100 on 2026-01-27T08:00:00Z, economy class, seat 12A, price 299. BK002 is unrelated (AA200 business). Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking; change >24h before departure, so no fee. Alternatives found: AA101 (14:00Z departure), AA102 (20:00Z evening, preferred, cheaper at 279 economy, 67 seats available). Seat info unavailable for AA102, but general availability confirmed. Fare difference: credit of $20 possible for AA102. Sufficient info to inform customer of options, policy, no fees, and offer to proceed with reschedule to AA102 (or AA101). No need for more tools; respond politely, confirm details, propose change, await confirmation before calling reschedule_booking tool in future interaction. Be professional.

Hello Mr. John Smith (Customer ID: C001),

Thank you for contacting SkyWings Airlines customer service. I've verified your details using your email (john.smith@email.com) and confirmed your booking BK001 for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on 2026-01-27 at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total price: $299).

I understand your meeting is running late, and you'd like to reschedule to a later flight on the same day, preferably evening. Our records show you're a Gold frequent flyer member, which entitles you to one free change per booking. Additionally, since this request is more than 24 hours before departure, there is no change fee applicable.

Available alternative flights on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX (all scheduled with availability):
- AA101: Departs 14:00 UTC, arrives 17:30 UTC (economy price: $329, 23 seats available)
- AA102: Departs 20:00 UTC (evening), arrives 23:30 UTC (economy price: $279, 67 seats available) – this matches your preference and is cheaper than your original ($20 difference as travel credit).

No fare difference charge applies if selecting AA102 (credit issued); AA101 would incur a $30 upcharge.

Would you like me to reschedule BK001 to AA102 (or AA101)? Please confirm the flight number, and let me know if you have a seat preference (economy class assumed; specific seat availability details are currently unavailable, but general seats are open). Once confirmed, I'll process the change immediately and send you updated details.

Looking forward to your confirmation!

Best regards,
SkyWings Airlines Customer Service
