        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.

    The customer, John Smith (email: john.smith@email.com), wants to reschedule their booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-27). No booking ID provided yet.

    To proceed with rescheduling:
    1. Verify customer identity and retrieve booking details using get_customer_info by email.
    2. Confirm original flight details (departure time) using get_flight_info for AA100.
    3. Check change policy using search_airline_policy for "change".
    4. Once I have booking ID and original time, search for later flights (evening) on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX.

    Act on first three in parallel to gather info.

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.

        The customer, John Smith (email: john.smith@email.com), wants to reschedule their booking for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on tomorrow (2026-01-27). No booking ID provided yet.

        To proceed with rescheduling:
        1. Verify customer identity and retrieve booking details using get_customer_info by email.
        2. Confirm original flight details (departure time) using get_flight_info for AA100.
        3. Check change policy using search_airline_policy for "change".
        4. Once I have booking ID and original time, search for later flights (evening) on 2026-01-27 from JFK to LAX.

        Act on first three in parallel to gather info.

    Customer C001 (Gold tier) has bookings BK001 and BK002. Need to identify which is for AA100 on 2026-01-27.

    Gold tier: 1 free change per booking.

    Original flight AA100 departs 2026-01-27 08:00 UTC (early morning).

    Change is >24 hours before departure, so eligible for free change (per Gold benefits).

    Next:
    - Retrieve details for both bookings to confirm which one matches AA100 JFK-LAX.
    - Search for alternative later flights (evening preferred) on 2026-01-27 JFK to LAX.

    Once identified, propose options, inform policy/fees (free), get confirmation before rescheduling.

        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

    Hello Mr. Smith,

    Thank you for contacting SkyWings Airlines customer service. I've verified your identity and details using your email (john.smith@email.com). You have booking BK001 for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on 2026-01-27 at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total $299).

    As a Gold frequent flyer member, you are eligible for one free change per booking. Since this request is more than 24 hours before departure, there is no change fee. However, any fare difference will apply: if the new flight costs more, you'll pay the difference; if less, you'll receive a travel credit.

    I've searched for later flights on the same day (2026-01-27) from JFK to LAX:
    - AA101: Departs 14:00 UTC, arrives 17:30 UTC, economy $329 (fare difference +$30)
    - AA102: Departs 20:00 UTC (evening), arrives 23:30 UTC, economy $279 (fare credit -$20)

    AA102 matches your preference for an evening flight and has good availability (67 seats).

    Would you like me to reschedule BK001 to AA102? Please confirm, and let me know if you'd like a specific seat (economy available) or prefer AA101 instead. Once confirmed, I'll process the change and send you updated details.

    Best regards,
    SkyWings Customer Service

Hello Mr. Smith,

Thank you for contacting SkyWings Airlines customer service. I've verified your identity and details using your email (john.smith@email.com). You have booking BK001 for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on 2026-01-27 at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total $299).

As a Gold frequent flyer member, you are eligible for one free change per booking. Since this request is more than 24 hours before departure, there is no change fee. However, any fare difference will apply: if the new flight costs more, you'll pay the difference; if less, you'll receive a travel credit.

I've searched for later flights on the same day (2026-01-27) from JFK to LAX:
- AA101: Departs 14:00 UTC, arrives 17:30 UTC, economy $329 (fare difference +$30)
- AA102: Departs 20:00 UTC (evening), arrives 23:30 UTC, economy $279 (fare credit -$20)

AA102 matches your preference for an evening flight and has good availability (67 seats).

Would you like me to reschedule BK001 to AA102? Please confirm, and let me know if you'd like a specific seat (economy available) or prefer AA101 instead. Once confirmed, I'll process the change and send you updated details.

Best regards,
SkyWings Customer Service
