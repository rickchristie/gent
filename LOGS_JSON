        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

        <available_tools>
        Call tools using JSON format:
        {"tool": "tool_name", "args": {...}}

        For multiple parallel calls, use an array:
        [{"tool": "tool1", "args": {...}}, {"tool": "tool2", "args": {...}}]

    The customer is John Smith, email john.smith@email.com, wants to reschedule booking on flight AA100 JFK-LAX tomorrow (2026-01-25) to a later evening flight same day.

    Steps required:
    1. Verify identity and booking: Use get_customer_info by email to get customer details and likely booking ID(s).
    2. Confirm original flight: get_flight_info for AA100.
    3. Check change policy: search_airline_policy with 'change'.
    4. Find alternatives: search_flight_schedule JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25 for later flights.

    Perform these in parallel first. No booking ID yet, so can't get_booking_info. After tools, analyze for later flights (need original departure time to know "later").

        Hi, I'm John Smith and my email is john.smith@email.com.
        I have a flight booked for tomorrow (flight AA100 from JFK to LAX) but my meeting is running late.
        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.
        </task>

        <thinking>
        The customer is John Smith, email john.smith@email.com, wants to reschedule booking on flight AA100 JFK-LAX tomorrow (2026-01-25) to a later evening flight same day.

        Steps required:
        1. Verify identity and booking: Use get_customer_info by email to get customer details and likely booking ID(s).
        2. Confirm original flight: get_flight_info for AA100.
        3. Check change policy: search_airline_policy with 'change'.
        4. Find alternatives: search_flight_schedule JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25 for later flights.

        Perform these in parallel first. No booking ID yet, so can't get_booking_info. After tools, analyze for later flights (need original departure time to know "later").

    Customer ID: C001 (Gold tier), bookings: BK001, BK002. Need to identify which booking is for AA100 on 2026-01-25.

    Original flight AA100 departs 08:00Z. Later options: AA101 (14:00Z, afternoon), AA102 (20:00Z, evening preferred).

    Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Today (2026-01-24) is >24h before departure, so free change applies. Fare difference: AA102 economy $279 (cheaper than original $299), so credit; AA101 $329 (more expensive).

    Next: Get details for both bookings to confirm which is AA100. Check seat availability for AA101 and AA102 (economy assumed). Propose evening AA102 first.

        <re_act>
        You are an AI assistant that solves problems using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern.

        ## How ReAct Works

        You will solve problems through a cycle of:
        1. **Think**: Analyze the current situation, reason about what you know, and decide what to do next.
        2. **Act**: Take an action by calling one of the available tools.
        3. **Observe**: Review the results of your action.

        Repeat this cycle until you have enough information to provide a final answer.

        ## Important Guidelines

        - Always think before acting. Explain your reasoning clearly.
        - Use tools to gather information. Don't make up facts.
        - If a tool call fails, analyze the error and try a different approach.
        - When you have sufficient information to answer, provide your final response.
        - Be concise but thorough in your reasoning.
        </re_act>

        <critical_rules>
        DO NOT HALLUCINATE
        - Every claim in your answer MUST come from tool outputs or user-provided information
        - NEVER invent specific data (IDs, prices, times, availability)
        - If information is missing, say so explicitly
        </critical_rules>

        <available_tools>
        Call tools using JSON format:
        {"tool": "tool_name", "args": {...}}

        For multiple parallel calls, use an array:

        Can you help me reschedule to a later flight on the same day? I'd prefer an evening flight if possible.

        Customer ID: C001 (Gold tier), bookings: BK001, BK002. Need to identify which booking is for AA100 on 2026-01-25.

        Original flight AA100 departs 08:00Z. Later options: AA101 (14:00Z, afternoon), AA102 (20:00Z, evening preferred).

        Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Today (2026-01-24) is >24h before departure, so free change applies. Fare difference: AA102 economy $279 (cheaper than original $299), so credit; AA101 $329 (more expensive).

        Next: Get details for both bookings to confirm which is AA100. Check seat availability for AA101 and AA102 (economy assumed). Propose evening AA102 first.

    Customer verified: John Smith, C001, Gold tier. Relevant booking: BK001 on AA100 (economy, 12A, $299), departs 2026-01-25 08:00Z.

    Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Change >24h before departure, so no fee. Fare difference applies: AA101 ($329) would require +$30 payment; AA102 ($279) gives $20 travel credit.

    Alternatives on 2026-01-25 JFK-LAX:
    - AA101: 14:00Z, 23 seats available, economy seats e.g. 20A available.
    - AA102: 20:00Z (evening, preferred), 67 seats available (seat query failed but high availability indicates options).

    Enough info to propose options to customer: Suggest AA102 first, inform free change + fare credit, ask for confirmation on which flight and any seat preference. Do not reschedule yet without confirmation. If confirmed later, use reschedule_booking then.

    No more tools needed; provide polite professional response with details.

    Hello John Smith, thank you for contacting SkyWings Airlines customer service. I have verified your identity and details associated with john.smith@email.com (Customer ID: C001, Gold frequent flyer tier).

    Your booking BK001 is confirmed for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25, departing at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total $299).

    As a Gold tier member, you are eligible for **one free change per booking** (no change fee applies since this request is more than 24 hours before departure). Any fare difference will apply: if the new flight costs more, you'll pay the difference; if less, you'll receive travel credit.

    I found the following later flights on the same day (2026-01-25, JFK to LAX):
    - **AA101**: Departs 14:00 UTC, arrives 17:30 UTC. Economy price: $329 (+$30 to pay). 23 economy seats available (e.g., 20A window seat).
    - **AA102** (evening option): Departs 20:00 UTC, arrives 23:30 UTC. Economy price: $279 ($20 travel credit). 67 economy seats available.

    I recommend AA102 as it matches your preference for an evening flight and is cheaper than your original booking.

    Please confirm which flight you'd like to switch to (AA101 or AA102), and if you have a seat preference (economy assumed). Once confirmed, I can process the reschedule immediately and send you updated details.

    Looking forward to your reply!

Customer ID: C001 (Gold tier), bookings: BK001, BK002. Need to identify which booking is for AA100 on 2026-01-25.

Original flight AA100 departs 08:00Z. Later options: AA101 (14:00Z, afternoon), AA102 (20:00Z, evening preferred).

Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Today (2026-01-24) is >24h before departure, so free change applies. Fare difference: AA102 economy $279 (cheaper than original $299), so credit; AA101 $329 (more expensive).

Next: Get details for both bookings to confirm which is AA100. Check seat availability for AA101 and AA102 (economy assumed). Propose evening AA102 first.

Customer verified: John Smith, C001, Gold tier. Relevant booking: BK001 on AA100 (economy, 12A, $299), departs 2026-01-25 08:00Z.

Policy: Gold tier gets 1 free change per booking. Change >24h before departure, so no fee. Fare difference applies: AA101 ($329) would require +$30 payment; AA102 ($279) gives $20 travel credit.

Alternatives on 2026-01-25 JFK-LAX:
- AA101: 14:00Z, 23 seats available, economy seats e.g. 20A available.
- AA102: 20:00Z (evening, preferred), 67 seats available (seat query failed but high availability indicates options).

Enough info to propose options to customer: Suggest AA102 first, inform free change + fare credit, ask for confirmation on which flight and any seat preference. Do not reschedule yet without confirmation. If confirmed later, use reschedule_booking then.

No more tools needed; provide polite professional response with details.

Hello John Smith, thank you for contacting SkyWings Airlines customer service. I have verified your identity and details associated with john.smith@email.com (Customer ID: C001, Gold frequent flyer tier).

Your booking BK001 is confirmed for flight AA100 from JFK to LAX on 2026-01-25, departing at 08:00 UTC (economy class, seat 12A, total $299).

As a Gold tier member, you are eligible for **one free change per booking** (no change fee applies since this request is more than 24 hours before departure). Any fare difference will apply: if the new flight costs more, you'll pay the difference; if less, you'll receive travel credit.

I found the following later flights on the same day (2026-01-25, JFK to LAX):
- **AA101**: Departs 14:00 UTC, arrives 17:30 UTC. Economy price: $329 (+$30 to pay). 23 economy seats available (e.g., 20A window seat).
- **AA102** (evening option): Departs 20:00 UTC, arrives 23:30 UTC. Economy price: $279 ($20 travel credit). 67 economy seats available.

I recommend AA102 as it matches your preference for an evening flight and is cheaper than your original booking.

Please confirm which flight you'd like to switch to (AA101 or AA102), and if you have a seat preference (economy assumed). Once confirmed, I can process the reschedule immediately and send you updated details.

Looking forward to your reply!
Best regards,
SkyWings Airlines Customer Service
